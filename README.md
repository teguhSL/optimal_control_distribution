# Probabilistic Iterative LQR for Short Time Horizon MPC
Repository for computing the probability distribution of an optimal control problem and use a short horizon MPC tracking controller to track the trajectory distribution. It contains the codes to run the experiments in the paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06349). 

To run the experiments, use the following notebooks:
- panda.ipynb
- quadcopter.ipynb
